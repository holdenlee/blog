# Two short stories a day...

Since November, I've been reading an average of 2 short stories every day, mostly science fiction and fantasy. 

As Junot Diaz once told me, "Read a thousand short stories and you'll know how to write one." It's been good to immerse myself in story every day and get a idea of the variety of things out there. I'm cataloguing all the short stories I read in a table (using [airtable](https://airtable.com/)), where I jot down basic information about the story, quotes I like, and rate it so I can easily find it later. As of today, it has 367 entries (of which 58 have 5-star ratings).

Every few months, I plan to go back through my list and post the stories I liked the most. They may or may not actually have been published recently.

I welcome recommendations for stories! Just leave a comment.
