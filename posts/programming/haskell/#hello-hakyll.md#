# Why Hakyll?

I've decided to switch blogging platforms from Wordpress to Hakyll, a website generation platform that can be customized using Haskell. The following two blog posts articulate some of my reasons for doing so:

* [Why switch from Wordpress to Jekyll?](http://karpathy.github.io/2014/07/01/switching-to-jekyll/)
* [Why switch from Jekyll to Hakyll?](http://mark.reid.name/blog/switching-to-hakyll.html)

Here is my own list of reasons:

* I want to have the freedom to edit 

Writing posts in Wordpress is clunky. I have to work inside its editor.I often like to start writing posts 

* I want my posts to be as close to plain text as possible. See [Gwern](http://www.gwern.net/About#long-site) and especially the quote by Julian Assange on why this is 

* I want to have complete control over my blog, not because I'm distri 

. I often have to fight with the formatting (especially on lists that get corrupted)
* 
* I like having complete control over
* I want to be able

There are many beautifully organized blogs written in Hakyll
