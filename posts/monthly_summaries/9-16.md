* Books
	* [The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, Carson McCullers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37380.The_Heart_is_a_Lonely_Hunter): McCullers gets in the head of the characters in a natural/free-flow way, so it's easy to resonate with their hopes/fear/anger/etc.; she weaves their perspectives/lives together very well into a vibrant world. It feels very in touch with humanity. A lot on how people connect/don't connect/hang their hearts on each other. People are lonely. End is sad, makes me think.
	* I'm continuing to read [The Great Conversation: A historical introduction to philosophy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/109588.The_Great_Conversation?ac=1&from_search=true). [Notes](https://workflowy.com/s/wL3CyEXpHY#/83fe67c598f6).
