Here's a list of what I've read/listened to/watched the past month.

(\*) means particularly interesting, and (h) are links to personal highlights.

I'm taking notes on the classes I'm attending this semester (tenatively MAT515, MAT597, and MAT519). They will be available under the "Notes" tab above.

- Rationality, Productivity, Life advice
	- [Generalizing from one example](http://lesswrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/) ([h](http://scrible.com/s/kzAym))
    - [The illusion of explanatory depth](http://scienceblogs.com/mixingmemory/2006/11/16/the-illusion-of-explanatory-de/) ([h](http://scrible.com/s/61N66)), see also [here](http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2015/12/22/illusion-of-explanatory-depth/), [original paper](http://www.yale.edu/cogdevlab/aarticles/IOED%20proofs.pdf%201.pdf)
    - I started using [Mnemosyne](http://mnemosyne-proj.org/), a flash-card tool that uses spaced repetition.
		- [Using memory software to learn Japanese](https://nihongoperapera.com/mnemosyne.html)
		- Why isn't spaced repetition software more popular? [Part 1](http://qsdeutschland.de/en/why-isnt-spaced-repetition-software-more-popular/), [Part 2](http://qsdeutschland.de/en/why-isnt-spaced-repetition-software-more-popular-part-2/)
        - [When is spaced repetition appropriate?](http://lesswrong.com/lw/juq/a_vote_against_spaced_repetition/)
        - [20 rules](http://lesswrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/) ([h](http://scrible.com/s/kzAym)) (I'm not sure I agree with all these. Use your judgment.)
		- If you like a nice-looking web app instead, try [Memrise]( http://www.memrise.com/).
    - Life advice
        - (\*) [Stop trying to try and just try](http://mindingourway.com/stop-trying-to-try-and-try/ http://scrible.com/s/iHN0m) ([h](http://scrible.com/s/iHN0m))
        - [The art of response](http://mindingourway.com/the-art-of-response/) ([h](http://scrible.com/s/iHN0m))
        - [6 harsh truths that will make you a better person](http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-harsh-truths-that-will-make-you-better-person/) (Summary: What you are is determined by what you do, and is important insofar as it determines what you do. Don't say "deep inside me there's a writer," just write. The world is a needy place - it does no good to "need" things. Produce things of value. It's easier to criticize than create - but a little bit of creation is far braver than a vast mountain of criticizing.)
        - [Don't ask yourself what do I want to do](http://qz.com/584874/you-probably-know-to-ask-yourself-what-do-i-want-heres-a-way-better-question/) [h](http://scrible.com/s/4FN46) (Summary: Don't ask what you're passionate about, ask what struggles you're willing to endure.)
        - [Screw finding your passion](http://markmanson.net/passion)
    - ["Giving honest negative feedback to someone we care about can actually be a huge display of vulnerability."](http://alexzhu.me/2015/06/22/the-vulnerability-in-giving-criticism/) ([h](http://scrible.com/s/g3x2m))
    - [Materialism vs. experientialism is a wrong dichotomy](http://alexzhu.me/2015/04/06/materialism-vs-experientialism-is-a-wrong-dichotomy/) ([h](http://scrible.com/s/g3N2m))
    - [What are some blogs/websites I would like if I like The Last Psychiatrist?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-blogs-websites-I-would-like-if-I-like-The-Last-Psychiatrist)
- Education
    - [Criteria for fact-based apps](https://tjzager.wordpress.com/2016/01/05/my-criteria-for-fact-based-apps/) What makes a app teaching multiplication facts, etc. good?
    - [Problem-based learning needs a different crux](http://blog.mrmeyer.com/2016/problem-based-learning-needs-a-different-crux/) - Don't try to "elicit the right question" - that's mind control.
- Programming, Haskell
    - [Dear Engineer: So, You Wanna Become an Entrepreneur?](http://degoes.net/articles/engineer-entrepreneur/), John A De Goes
    - [Free monads as a modern architecture for FP](http://degoes.net/articles/modern-fp/)

    - IndieFeed
		- [Sarah Kay](http://indiefeedpp.libsyn.com/sarah-kay-the-table-game)
        - [The End of It](http://indiefeedpp.libsyn.com/cristin-okeefe-aptowicz-the-end-of-it)
    - (\*) Reply-all/Radiolab: [The Cathedral](https://gimletmedia.com/episode/50-the-cathedral/) A moving piece on the creation of [That Dragon, Cancer](http://www.thatdragoncancer.com/#home), a computer game based off a parent's experience losing a child to cancer. 
    - TED Radio Hour
        - [Building better cities](http://www.npr.org/programs/ted-radio-hour/462178064/building-better-cities?showDate=2016-01-08)
            - Daniele Quercia talks about making an mapping app that focuses on the most beautiful parts of cities (found through crowdsourcing).
            - Benjamin Barber and Kasim Reed talk about how mayors are the ones solving some of the most challenging social problems. Mayors are closer to the people (cities are closer to direct democracy), and focus on problem-solving rather than ideology. Barber created the [Global Parliament of Mayors](http://www.globalparliamentofmayors.org/). ([h1](http://scrible.com/s/01xOm), [h2](http://scrible.com/s/21xOm))
			
		        > Until you see a city how people who are most in need of help see it, you're never going to reach them... And I think that if you don't take care of the basics and do them very well -make sure that the finances of the city are well-run, make sure that you provide police services, pick up trash, fix potholes - that you will never be able to do anything aspirational. And once you take on those issues and solve them, the public will then allow you to spend resources on the things that you care about.

    - Fun
        - (\*) [Undertale](http://undertale.com/) is an AMAZING game. It has amazing story and character, great gameplay, good humor, inventive mechanics, and lots of easter eggs. Most interestingly, it subverts the RPG genre of killing monsters, allowing a pacifist run that brings out the "true story" (on the flip side, there's a genocide run...) AND people have turned the boss battles into Stepmania:
