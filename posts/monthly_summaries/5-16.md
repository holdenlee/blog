I've put all the links for this month in this [workflowy](https://workflowy.com/s/wL3CyEXpHY#/d1a52d188a8f?q=%232016-5). (See [April's post](4-16.html) for an explanation of the organization.) Because this post is late, I've also put in some links from the first few days of June.

Here are some highlights.

* [Notes on conceptual fiction](http://www.conceptualfiction.com/index.html) [h](http://scrible.com/s/gBNS4): Saying something is in the genre of "conceptual fiction" is more informative than saying something is "science fiction". Conceptual fiction sacrifices realism to allow playing with ideas.

			> Grad school, together with your postdoc, are your time to leap for the moon. It’s not preparation for anything else; it’s the thing that you’ve been preparing for. This is when there’s a very good chance that you’ll think many of your most original thoughts and do much of your most important work.
