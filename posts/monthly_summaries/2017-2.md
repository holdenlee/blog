# Books

* [One flew over the cuckoo's nest](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/332613.One_Flew_Over_the_Cuckoo_s_Nest) - Set in a psychiatric hospital, but manages to a hopeful and humorous (and sad) story.

* Farseer trilogy, Robin Hobb - follows the life of an assassin, with all its moral dilemmas. I liked the treatment of magic (the Skill - telepathic ability to talk with or influence other people - and the Wit - a communing with animals).

A [command line tutorial](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial).
* [The invisible heart: An economic romance, Russell Roberts](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22414.The_Invisible_Heart) - A conversation about economics delightfully embedded in a love story. Made some good arguments for deregulation.
* [Diaspora, Greg Egan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/156785.Diaspora) - Greg Egan goes very far in imagining the evolution of minds in cyberspace. Some interesting metaphors for mathematics. Different ways of embedding life/computation in the universe. A journey through multiple universes in search for...?
* Comics!

	* [Saga 1](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15704307-saga-vol-1) A couple from opposite sides of a galactic war tries to escape being hunted on all sides. Writing and art is fantastic. Also, +1 for Esperanto.

Starting with several stories of Twitter shaming gone out of control, investigates how public shaming has transformed in recent years, the morality and role of public shaming, how to mitigate it, etc. 

[^f1]: A quote: when we feel gratitude we're more generous to strangers, when we're more aware of luck's importance, we're more likely to plow our own fortune back into the common good. But we underplay luck because we can recall our own struggles far  better than the fateful but fuzzy role of chance and because the very idea corrodes our faith in free will, but mostly because like Benny Franklin, we're deeply invested in our own autobiographies.
