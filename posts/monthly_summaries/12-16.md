See all the links for [November](https://workflowy.com/s/wL3CyEXpHY#/d1a52d188a8f?q=%232016-11) and [December](https://workflowy.com/s/wL3CyEXpHY#/d1a52d188a8f?q=%232016-12). (See [April's post](4-16.html) for an explanation of the organization.) Here are some highlights. 

* Putting the election in perspective
    * Pre-election posts

		* Slatestarcodex: [Tuesday shouldn't change the narrative](http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/11/07/tuesday-shouldnt-change-the-narrative/)
		*   [The smug style in American liberalism](http://www.vox.com/2016/4/21/11451378/smug-american-liberalism) [h](http://scrible.com/s/gexAS)
		    
			>  If the smug style can be reduced to a single sentence, it's, Why are they voting against their own self-interest?...
			>  
			>  If Donald Trump has a chance in November, it is because the knowing will dictate our strategy. Unable to countenance the real causes of their collapse, they will comfort with own impotence by shouting, "Idiots!" again and again, angrier and angrier, the handmaidens of their own destruction.
			> 
			> The smug style resists empathy for the unknowing. It denies the possibility of a politics whereby those who do not share knowing culture, who do not like the right things or know the Good Facts or recognize the intellectual bankruptcy of their own ideas can be worked with, in spite of these differences, toward a common goal...
			> 
			> It is impossible, in the long run, to cleave the desire to help people from the duty to respect them...
			> 
			> The smug style, at bottom, is a failure of empathy. Further: It is a failure to believe that empathy has any value at all.
