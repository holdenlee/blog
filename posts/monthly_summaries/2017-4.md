# Books

* [The Metaphysical Club, Louis Menand](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28202.The_Metaphysical_Club): Discusses the evolution of American philosophy in the 19th and early 20th century in response to the Civil War and scientific progress (ex. Darwin's theory of evolution), through the story of 4 American philosphers (William James, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Charles Peirce, and John Dewey). [Notes](https://workflowy.com/s/4qkO9xWz4M#/9ccd29dd9117)

* [Blindsight, Peter Watts](http://www.rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm) asks the question: what if the correlation of consciousness and intelligence on Earth is just an accident - and the universe is filled with intelligent but nonconscious beings? It makes a strong (scientific, non-dualistic) argument for the possibility that intelligence need not be correlated with consciousness.
