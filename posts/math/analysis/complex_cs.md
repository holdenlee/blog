Here are notes for my talk "Crash course in complex analysis" for the Gems of TCS seminar. 

* For a crash course, see the first chapter in my notes on analytic number theory, [http://tiny.cc/annt](http://tiny.cc/annt).
* For applications, see notes [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fn854rj0j98ij6d/complex_cs.pdf?dl=0).

**Abstract**: Calculus on the complex numbers has an entirely different attitude from calculus on the reals. The additional structure of the complex numbers greatly enriches the theory of differentiable functions. I will cover (the many variants of) Cauchy's Theorem, power (Laurent) series, and various inequalities (Hadamard three-lines and three-circles). I'll give some applications including convergence rates for polynomial approximations and numerical integration, and a recent application to population recovery.
