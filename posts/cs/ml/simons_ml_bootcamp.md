I'm currently attending the [Foundations of Machine Learning](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/machinelearning2017) program at the Simons Institute. 

Here are my [notes](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/27883775/wiki/math/pdfs/simons_ml.pdf) for the first workshop (Foundation of Machine Learning Boot Camp). Source is available on [github](https://github.com/holdenlee/simons-ml).

I will update this page as the workshop progresses.
