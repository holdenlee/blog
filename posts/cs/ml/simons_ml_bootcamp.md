I'm currently attending the [Foundations of Machine Learning](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/machinelearning2017) program at the Simons Institute. 

Here are my [notes](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cbwmt7i2o9p0ki0/simons_ml.pdf?dl=0) for the first workshop (Foundation of Machine Learning Boot Camp). Source is available on [github](https://github.com/holdenlee/simons-ml).

I'm also taking notes on seminars and reading groups at the Simons Program in Machine Learning. All notes are available on the [Simons Program wiki](http://simons.squidhive.net/Notes).

I will update this page as the workshop progresses.
