I'm currently attending the [Interactive Learning](https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/machinelearning2017-1) workshop at the Simons Institute. 

Here are my [notes](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mxbbdv8i11f63an/interactive_workshop.pdf?dl=0). Source is available on [github](https://github.com/holdenlee/simons-ml).

I'm also taking notes on seminars and reading groups at the Simons Program in Machine Learning. All notes are available on the [Simons Program wiki](http://simons.squidhive.net/Notes).

I will update this page as the workshop progresses.
