<blockquote>
<p>If the smug style can be reduced to a single sentence, it’s, Why are they voting against their own self-interest?…</p>
<p>If Donald Trump has a chance in November, it is because the knowing will dictate our strategy. Unable to countenance the real causes of their collapse, they will comfort with own impotence by shouting, “Idiots!” again and again, angrier and angrier, the handmaidens of their own destruction.</p>
<p>The smug style resists empathy for the unknowing. It denies the possibility of a politics whereby those who do not share knowing culture, who do not like the right things or know the Good Facts or recognize the intellectual bankruptcy of their own ideas can be worked with, in spite of these differences, toward a common goal…</p>
<p>It is impossible, in the long run, to cleave the desire to help people from the duty to respect them…</p>
<p>The smug style, at bottom, is a failure of empathy. Further: It is a failure to believe that empathy has any value at all.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.purescript.org/">Purescript</a> is a functional programming language that compiles down to Javascript. In this post, I describe the process of building a simple game, Snake, in PureScript. Along the way, we’ll see how input/signals work, how to render to the screen, and how to work with arrays. I assume familiarity with functional programming. I’ll make some comparisons with Haskell and Elm.</p>
<p>I like Purescript because it has the functional power of <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>, while fitting very well into the web ecosystem (e.g. interops with Javascript), like <a href="http://www.elm-lang.org">Elm</a>. Think of it as Elm with all the features that come with Haskell, such as monads. <!--foreign functions--></p>

<p>You will need to install all these packages. You can install them one at a time via</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">bower</span> install <span class="op">&lt;</span>package-name<span class="op">&gt;</span> --save</code></pre></div>
<p>or copy the <code>bower.json</code> file <a href="https://github.com/holdenlee/purescript-games/blob/master/bower.json">here</a> and do <code>bower install</code> to install all of them at once.</p>
<h2 id="the-model-update-view-signal-architecture">The Model-Update-View-Signal Architecture</h2>
<p>We break our program into the following parts. (For more information, see the <a href="http://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/">Elm architecture tutorial</a>.)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Model</strong>: This is a complete description of the state of the program at any time. For Snake, this would include the array containing all points of the snake, the direction it is going, and the location of the mouse.</li>
<li><strong>Update</strong>: Define a <code>step</code> function which given an input and the current model, returns the updated model. For Snake, an update would be the direction, and the step function would move the snake one unit in that direction, and check for things like whether the snake ate the mouse or bumped into the wall.</li>
<li><strong>View</strong>: Given a model, describe how to render it on the screen.</li>
<li><strong>Signal</strong>: Specify the input signals. A signal of type <code>a</code> is a time-varying value of type <code>a</code>. For a primer on signals see <a href="http://elm-lang.org:1234/guide/reactivity#signals">here</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/mvus.png"></p>
<p>To put these components together we use:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>foldp</code>, the magic function that “folds” the input signals into the model via the <code>step</code> function. Note the similarity to <a href="http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-02-DataList-Illustrated/">foldl</a> both in the type signature and the picture. In the picture <code>a</code> corresponds to <code>Input</code> and <code>b</code> corresponds to <code>Model</code>. So given time-varying inputs and a starting model, <code>foldp</code> produces a time-varying model.</p>
<pre><code>foldp :: forall a b. (a -&gt; b -&gt; b) -&gt; b -&gt; (Signal a) -&gt; (Signal b)</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>runSignal</code>: Given a signal encapsulating an effect, makes the effect happen.</p>
<pre><code>runSignal :: forall e. Signal (Eff e Unit) -&gt; Eff e Unit</code></pre>
<p>(In the old version of Elm, <code>main</code> is simply a <code>Signal</code>, but here, the type of <code>main</code> is an analogue of <code>IO</code> in Haskell.)</p></li>
</ul>
<!-- which given a signal of type `a` and a way to turn something of type `a` into an effect (e.g. a way to render it), makes the effect happen (e.g. renders it). -->
<p>The skeleton of the program looks like this.</p>

<p>The <code>Eff</code> monad corresponds to Haskell’s <code>IO</code> monad, but uses <em>extensible effects</em>: it lists out explicitly all the effects it has (access to randomness, DOM, drawing canvas, console, etc.). For example, <code>Eff (random :: RANDOM, canvas :: CANVAS | eff) Unit</code> means having effects that include <code>RANDOM</code> and <code>CANVAS</code>). PureScript will infer all effects if you put <code>_</code>. See <a href="https://leanpub.com/purescript/read#leanpub-auto-the-eff-monad-1">Chapter 8.10</a> of the PureScript book.</p>
<p>For a warm-up, <a href="https://github.com/holdenlee/purescript-games/blob/master/src/SimpleMove.purs">here</a> is a basic example following this paradigm. Here, the model is an integer (the location on a single axis), the update is moving -1, 0, or 1 units, the view is simply writing the location to the console, and the signal comes from the arrow keys once every second.</p>
<h2 id="model">Model</h2>
<p>For Snake, the model is a record containing</p>
<ul>
<li>the location of the <code>mouse</code></li>
<li><code>snake</code> as an array of points</li>
<li>whether the snake is <code>alive</code></li>
</ul>
<p>We also include some the dimensions <code>xd</code>, <code>yd</code> of the game board, the <code>size</code> of each square (alternatively, these can be hard-coded in), and the <code>prev</code> square (this is optional—it gives us an easy way to erase the tail of the snake when it moves). Valid positions are in <span class="math inline">\([1,xd]\times [1,yd]\)</span>.</p>
<p>We want the mouse location to be generated at random. How to do this? We’ll fill in that part later. (For now, you can put in an arbitrary point.)</p>
<p>Note also that the y-coordinate is 0 at the top of the screen and increases going down. The snake starts at the upper-left corner moving right.</p>

<p>Some differences from Haskell:</p>
<ul>
<li>Note that all partial functions must be notated with the empty type constraint <code>Partial</code>. <code>head</code> as imported from <code>Data.Array.Partial</code> is a partial function because it is undefined on <code>[]</code>. (We need not worry because the snake will never be empty.)</li>
<li>Polymorphic functions must have type variables listed out at the beginning after <code>forall</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that we can add points! (Note the line <code>head s + d</code>.) This is because <code>Data.Tuple</code> has the instance <code>(Ring a, Ring b) =&gt; Ring (Tuple a b)</code>. If both components of a tuple can be added, then addition is automatically defined for the tuple.</p>
<h2 id="view">View</h2>
<p>Given the model, we have 4 things to render: the walls (a <span class="math inline">\(27\times 27\)</span> rectangle here), the background (a <span class="math inline">\(25\times 25\)</span> rectangle), the snake and the mouse. For instructions on using <code>purescript-canvas</code> see <a href="https://leanpub.com/purescript/read#leanpub-auto-canvas-graphics">Chapter 9</a> of the PureScript book. Change the colors as you wish.</p>

<p>The render function is a bit inefficient since it is redrawing the entire canvas every step (it doesn’t make much difference for such a simple game though). We can replace later calls to <code>render</code> with <code>renderStep</code> which only changes the squares that need to be changed at each time step. (There is much more freedom than Elm to draw specify what you want to draw and redraw.)</p>

<h2 id="signal">Signal</h2>
<p>The <code>step</code> function takes an update of type <code>Point</code>, so we need to produce a <code>Signal Point</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-signal/8.0.0">purescript-signal</a> contains signals from various sources, e.g. which keys are pressed and the time. We use the following functions from there:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>keyPressed :: forall e. Int -&gt; Eff (dom :: DOM | e) (Signal Boolean)</code>. (Note we need access to the DOM to get a keybord signal.) The key codes for L/U/D/R are 37, 38, 40, 39. We map them to <span class="math inline">\((-1,0), (0,-1), (0,1), (1,0)\)</span>, respectively.</li>
<li><code>every :: Time -&gt; Signal Time</code> periodically signals the time.</li>
<li><code>sampleOn :: forall a b. (Signal a) -&gt; (Signal b) -&gt; (Signal b)</code> creates a signal which yields the current value of the second signal every time the first signal yields. Usually the first signal is a periodic time signal (e.g. <code>every second</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Below, <code>input</code> gives a direction corresponding to the arrow key pressed every 1/20 second.</p>

<p>But we don’t have randomness yet.</p>
<h2 id="adding-randomness">Adding randomness</h2>

<p>We need to add randomness as an effect.</p>
<h3 id="something-that-doesnt-work">Something that doesn’t work</h3>

<p>If you try this you will get very weird behavior: the mouse will jump all over the place! My best explanation for this is that the effects are compiled in un-executed form in the signal, and at each step, the effects are executed <em>starting from the beginning</em>. Not only does this mean that the random numbers generated are different, it means that the the program will run slower and slower. See a discussion <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/purescript/CeVEETR0U3U/oacKYPmXAwAJ">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="using-a-generator">Using a generator</h3>
<p>The standard way to do this is to include a <code>Seed</code> in the state, and whenever we need randomness, use the seed to generate a random number and a new seed, and update the seed. We can add a field for <code>seed</code> in <code>Model</code>…</p>
<p>But this is clunky, and just the kind of thing that monads make easier to express! This sounds like a <code>State Seed</code> and in fact, the <a href="https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-quickcheck/3.0.0/docs/Test.QuickCheck.Gen">Gen</a> monad is (basically) just this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">type</span> <span class="dt">GenState</span> <span class="fu">=</span> {<span class="ot"> newSeed ::</span> <span class="dt">Seed</span>,<span class="ot"> size ::</span> <span class="dt">Size</span> }

<span class="kw">newtype</span> <span class="dt">Gen</span> a <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dt">Gen</span> (<span class="dt">StateT</span> <span class="dt">GenState</span> <span class="dt">Identity</span> a)</code></pre></div>
<p>Our step function will no longer be <code>a -&gt; b -&gt; b</code>, but will draw on randomness, so will take the form <code>a -&gt; b -&gt; Gen b</code>. We now replace</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">foldp ::</span> forall a b<span class="fu">.</span> (a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> b <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> b) <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> b <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> (<span class="dt">Signal</span> a) <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> (<span class="dt">Signal</span> b)</code></pre></div>
<p>with the function</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">foldpR ::</span> forall a b e<span class="fu">.</span> (a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> b <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Gen</span> b) <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> b <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> (<span class="dt">Signal</span> a) <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Eff</span> (<span class="ot">random ::</span> <span class="dt">RANDOM</span> <span class="fu">|</span> e) (<span class="dt">Signal</span> b)</code></pre></div>
<p>This is very reusable, and will make anything else we write with randomness painless.</p>
<p>For this, we need a bit of footwork. Behind the scenes, we do as we said before: a function <code>f :: a -&gt; b -&gt; Gen b</code> is the same as a function <code>f' :: a -&gt; (b, GenState) -&gt; (b, GenState)</code>. We unravel <code>f</code>, and <code>foldp</code> using this <code>f'</code> as the step function and an initial seed. For sake of reusability, I’ve put <code>foldpR</code> in a separate module, in more generality than necessary, <a href="https://github.com/holdenlee/purescript-games/blob/master/src/SignalM.purs">here</a>; add <code>import SignalM</code> to <code>Snake</code>.</p>
<p>The function <code>step :: Partial =&gt; Point -&gt; Model -&gt; Model</code> is now <code>step :: Partial =&gt; Point -&gt; Model -&gt; Gen Model</code>. In the branch of the <code>if</code> statement where the snake eats the mouse, we keep generating points within the dimensions until the point is not part of the snake. Note that PureScript uses <code>pure</code> instead of <code>return</code>. We add <code>pure</code> to the other branches (not shown).</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">  <span class="kw">do</span> 
    newMouse <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> untilM (\pt <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> not (pt <span class="ot">`elem`</span> s <span class="fu">||</span> pt <span class="fu">==</span> hd)) (randomPoint m<span class="fu">.</span>xd m<span class="fu">.</span>yd)

             }</code></pre></div>
<p>The auxiliary functions here are (<code>untilM</code> being the monadic analogue of “repeat until”)</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">untilM ::</span> forall m a<span class="fu">.</span> (<span class="dt">Monad</span> m) <span class="ot">=&gt;</span> (a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Boolean</span>) <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> m a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> m a

      pure <span class="fu">$</span> <span class="dt">Tuple</span> x y</code></pre></div>
<p>We also similarly incorporate randomness in the starting model by replacing <code>start :: Model</code> with <code>init :: forall e. Eff (random::RANDOM | e) Model</code>. The final <code>main</code> looks like</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">main ::</span> <span class="dt">Eff</span> _ <span class="dt">Unit</span>
main <span class="fu">=</span>

<p>See all the code <a href="https://github.com/holdenlee/purescript-games/blob/master/src/Snake.purs">here</a>.</p>
<p>The version I linked to has a few extra lines of code so that pressing SPACE restarts the game; the additions are in <a href="https://github.com/holdenlee/purescript-games/blob/master/src/SnakeS.purs">SnakeS.purs</a>, at the bottom.</p>
<h2 id="building">Building</h2>
<p>To build the project, run</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="fu">mkdir</span> dist

<span class="ex">pulp</span> browserify -m Snake/index.js <span class="op">&gt;&gt;</span> dist/Snake.js</code></pre></div>
<p>Browserify creates a javascript file with all the javascript libraries included. We need a html file to host the javascript. Create <code>html/index.html</code> with a canvas of the appropriate dimensions:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><span class="dt">&lt;!DOCTYPE </span>html<span class="dt">&gt;</span>

<p>Now open the file and play!</p>
<!--
# Exercises

* Add a tab for score.
* Add a start screen. Press SPACE to begin. When the game ends, display "GAME OVER, SPACE to play again".
* Add sounds whenever the snake eats a mouse.
* Change the amount that the snake lengthens each time.
* Allow the user to adjust the speed and the lengthening rate.

    <p>First, an important announcement.</p>
<h2 id="trade-your-vote">Trade your vote!</h2>

<li><a href="http://nevertrump.trimian.com/">#NeverTrump</a></li>
<li><a href="https://voteswap.us/">voteswap.us</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The margin between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is dangerously close. Third-party candidates, with 5+% in polls, have a large number of votes which could change the outcome in swing states.</p>
<p>In 2000, Bush won the national election with a margin of 537 votes in Florida while Nader received 97,488 votes in Florida - far more than enough to tilt the election. Forseeing a close election, “NaderTrading” attempted to trade votes between Ralph Nader supporters in swing states such as Florida with Al Gore supporters in safe states, “teleporting” votes for Al Gore to the states where it would matter, while ensuring that Ralph Nader would receive as many votes as he would otherwise to have a chance of qualifying for federal funds.</p>
<p>voteswap2000.com could have changed the outcome of history - but was shut down by California’s attorney general; with only weeks left until the election, there was no time to appeal.</p>
<p>Let’s learn from history. (The point here is not to endorse Al Gore, but to illustrate of how effective vote-swapping can be.) The race is similarly close but we have new tools at our disposal:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Porter v. Bowen (2007) that vote-swapping is protected by first-amendment rights.</li>
<li>We have SOCIAL MEDIA.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hillary Clinton supporters in safe states swapping votes with anti-Trump third-party supporters in battleground states can potentially change history. If you are in either category please sign up at one of the sites.</p>

It’s simply that the clown had the guts to stand up to this scolding authority figure who presumes to tell the class every day what they are and aren’t allowed to think.</p>

    <p>These are my notes on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6649312-whistling-vivaldi?ac=1&amp;from_search=true">Whistling Vivaldi: And Other Clues to How Stereotypes Affect Us</a> by Claude Steele.</p>
<p>The book is very revealing, showing through many careful experimental studies how stereotypes have wide-ranging effects beyond our conscious awareness—for example, how just simply <em>being</em> in a society where there are stereotypes can depress academic performance of black students or math scores of female students. (Incidentally, this makes a strong argument for affirmative action in certain cases.) Moreover, it proposes several steps we can take counteract these stereotypes.</p>
<h2 id="an-introduction-at-the-root-of-identity">1 An introduction: at the root of identity</h2>
<h3 id="section">1</h3>
<p>Claude Steele first realized he was black when he learned blacks couldn’t swim at the neighborhood pool except on Wednesday afternoons. This is an example of an <strong>identity contingency</strong>, something a person deals with because of a given social identity. The book will show that identity contingencies have a strong effect on standardized test scores, memory, comfort level, etc. A central identity contingency is <strong>stereotype threat</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="section-1">2</h3>
<p>Brent Staples, an African American man, recounts how when he walked down the streets of Chicago Hyde Park, people were frightened of him (ex. moving to the other side of the street). When he whistled Vivaldi’s <em>Four Seasons</em>, however, he diffused the negative stereotype—people stopped being afraid of him. The stereotype of violent blacks was no longer applicable to him personally.</p>
<h3 id="section-2">3</h3>
<p>White students who were told that a golf task measures “natural athletic ability” did worse what white students in the control group, because there is a stereotype that compared with blacks, whites have less natural athletic ability.</p>
<p>Black students who were told that a golf task measures “sports strategic intelligence” did worse, because there is a stereotype of blacks being less intelligent.</p>
<!-- Stereotype threat is so persistent and powerful that it can't be overcome. -->
<h3 id="section-3">4</h3>
<p>Steele’s research shows the following general ideas:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Even though we think of ourselves as autonomous individuals, contingencies tied to our social identities have an undeniable effect on our lives.</li>
<li>Identity threats play an important role in society’s most important social problems.</li>
<li>These threats impair a broad range of human functioning through predictable psychological effects.</li>
<li>There are things we can do as <em>individuals</em> to reduce the impact of these threats.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="a-mysterious-link-between-identity-and-performance">2 A Mysterious link between identity and performance</h2>
<p>Edward Jones and Richard Nisbett argued that when explaining people’s behavior, the “observer’s perspective” and “actor’s perspective” are very different. An observer emphasizes things about the actor (characteristics, traits) while an actor is aware of the circumstances.</p>
<p>During his visit to Ann Arbor, Steele talked to minority students. They were concerned about the university environment and talked about being a minority. They talked about how social life was organized by race, expressed a desire for a place where they weren’t made aware of being a minority, and worried about how others see them. They didn’t have low expectations or make excuses for academic performance. Steele saw that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>among students with comparable academic skills, as measured by the SAT, black students got less of a return on those skills in college than other students.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-4">2</h3>
<p>Among their six closest friends, neither white nor black students averaged even one friend from the other racial group.</p>
<h3 id="section-5">3</h3>
<p>Underperformance didn’t seem to be caused primarily by racism by teachers and classmates, nor by motivational nor cultural defecits. Rather, it was caused by racialized aspects of campus life: racial marginalization, racial segregation of networks, group underrepresentation, etc. Social groups are important; for example, over 85% of Americans get jobs through acquaintances. Ideas of who and what was “cool” were dominated by whites.</p>
<h3 id="section-6">4</h3>
<p>Jane Elliott conducted an experiment where she treated blue-eyed and brown-eyed students differently, and found that the marginalized group performed significantly worse—they paid less attention, didn’t remember instructions, were slow, and got many answers wrong. Students’ environment seemed to be an actual component of ability.</p>
<p>How is this relevant outside of experiments? Schools inherit a social organization from the larger society and their own history that place black students under “downwardly constituting pressures” which can interfere directly with intellectual performance.</p>
<h3 id="section-7">5</h3>
<!--how do people maintain a perception of personal adequacy in the face of information that could threaten that perception?-->
<p>Steele hypothesizes that stigmatization is the primary cause of underperformance (Nancy Hewitt, Elaine Seymour).</p>
<p>Women report a “chilly climate” in advanced math classes, fearing their abilities are under suspicion, feminine characteristics discredit their seriousness, and that they have to prove themselves constantly.</p>
<p>Steele gave male and female students who performed equally well in math a section of the math GRE, and likewise for English literature. Taking a difficult math test puts a woman at risk for stigmatization because of the stereotype that women are worse at math.</p>
<p>Steele told one group</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You may have heard that woman don’t do as well as men on difficult standardized math tests, but that’s not true for the particular standardized math test; on this particular test, women always do as well as men.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This group did much better, equally as well as men.</p>
<p>(“Sterotype threat” is a worry of confirming a negative stereotype of one’s group.)</p>
<h3 id="section-8">6</h3>
<p>At a conference on women in science, Larry Summers (former president of Harvard) hypothesized “differential availability of aptitude at the high end” as a cause for disparaties between male and female performance. This was blown up by the media and he was pressured to resign (this was not the only cause). Steele’s experiment differentiated between the hypothesis of stereotype threat and this “second hypothesis” (underperformance is caused by something about women).</p>
<h2 id="stereotype-threat-comes-to-light-and-in-more-than-one-group">3 Stereotype threat comes to light, and in more than one group</h2>
<h3 id="section-9">1</h3>
<p>When the coach for the Seattle Supersonics was replaced, the team went from a losing to a winning streak. The sportscasters (from the viewpoint of observers) explained the losses with player deficiencies; when they started winning, their weaknesses were written into strengths.</p>
<h3 id="section-10">2</h3>
<p>In <em>Contempt and Pity</em>, Daryl Scott argues that people have been trying to explain the African American situation in terms of “psychic damage”, i.e., they internalize the bad depictions of themselves in society, hurting their confidence and expectation.</p>
<h3 id="section-11">3-6</h3>
<p>Followup questions after the research on women in math: Does <strong>stereotype threat</strong> generalize to other groups? What effect did intellectual strength and motivation have?</p>
<p>Findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stereotype threat affected other groups, such as African Americans. Steele nullified stereotype threat by saying that the test they would take was a task for studying problem solving in general, not a measure of intellectual ability.</li>
<li>It affected even the strongest, most motivated students.</li>
<li>The group who faced stereotype threat (the control group) came up with race or stereotype-related words when asked to fill in word fragments (<code>**mb-&gt;dumb</code>, <code>**ce-&gt;race</code>). When asked about preference for music and sports, they rated stereotypically black interests (hip-hop, basketball) lower in order to distance themselves from the stereotype. They reported sleeping less the day before (as a plausible excuse for poor performance).</li>
<li>Comparing black and white students with similar ability,
<ul>
<li>in the group who cared about school, black students underperformed compared to white students</li>
<li>in the group who didn’t care about school, black students performed equally (but worse than the group who cared). Stereotype threat had a greater effect on those who cared about academics.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-broader-view-of-identity-in-the-lives-of-anatole-broyard-amin-maalouf-and-the-rest-of-us">4 A Broader view of identity: in the lives of Anatole Broyard, Amin Maalouf, and the rest of us</h2>
<h3 id="section-12">1</h3>
<p>Anatole Broyard was a book reviewer for the New York Times who essentially changed his racial identity from black to white, immersing himself in white culture and social circles. By changing his racial identity, he could live in different places, have access to different resources (bank loans, professional network), education (for children), etc.</p>
<h3 id="section-13">2</h3>
<p><strong>Contingencies</strong> are conditions that are special to you because you have a given social identity.</p>
<p>For example, what are the identity contingencies for a white and black student in the cafeteria? A white student would be averse to sitting at a table of black students becuase of fear of being judged as inauthentic and racially insensitive, and because of cultural differences; similarly, a black student sitting at a white table would fear being met with disapproval and non-understanding, or being thought of as disloyal by other blacks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To explain the lunchroom’s racial segregation, one needn’t postulate even an iota of group prejudice on the part of any student in the room. Its segregation could arise solely to avoid the bad contingencies of these two group identities in that place.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-14">3</h3>
<p>There are more identity contingencies beyond age, sex, sexual orientation, race, like mental health status.</p>
<p>Identity threat is <em>diffuse</em>: one knows that a variety of negative things could happen, not that anything specific will. A diffuse threat is preoccupying.</p>
<h3 id="section-15">4</h3>
<p>From <em>In the Name of Identity: Violence and the Need to Belong</em>, Amin Maalouf argues that people can commit crimes in the name of an identity under siege, that they would never do for themselves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People often see themselves in terms of whichever one of their allegiances is most under attack. And sometimes, when a person doesn’t have the strength to defend that allegiance, he hides it… [until] it invades the person’s whole identity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we are threatened is when we are most aware of being a particular kind of person.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> We are not as aware of positive identity contingencies.</p>
<p>James Cormer, a successful school reformer, gives the following advice on facing discrimination. Ignore it the first two times, and then raise all hell. This addresses ambiguity, which is a constant concern (“was that meant to hurt me?”).</p>
<h3 id="section-16">5</h3>
<p>Students, after an estimation task, were told arbitrarily that they were over-estimators or under-estimators. Later they disciminated in favor of students in their own group, preferring a payout like <span class="math inline">\((+2,+1)\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\((+3,+3)\)</span> (not to scale). This is the <strong>minimal group effect</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our need for self-regard is powerful enough to make us care about even trivial group identities.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-17">6</h3>
<p>If our social identities are rooted in local contingencies, they are malleable. (Ex. in the experiments, a single statement changed students’ performance on tests.)</p>
<p>Many African-Americans expatriate to Paris. Why? One woman says that even though there is prejudice against blacks in France (though more strongly against North African immigrants), her “blackness” is no longer the most central thing about her when she meets people, like it is in the US. She feels like she was “first met as a full person” in Paris. The French see her as an educated black person.</p>
<p>Contrast <em>passing</em> (what Broyard did)—changing race but keeping country—with <em>expatriation</em>—keeping race but changing country.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you want to change the behaviors and outcomes associated with social identity—say, too few women in computer science—don’t focus on changing the internal manifestations of the identity, such as values, and attitudes. Focus instead on changing the contingencies to which all of that internal stuff is an adaptation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We don’t need to change something “disgraceful” about being a Negro; we need to change the “inconvenience” (identity contingencies) of being a Negro (Bert Williams).</p>
<h2 id="the-many-experiences-of-stereotype-threat">5 The many experiences of stereotype threat</h2>
<h3 id="section-18">1</h3>
<p>Stereotype threat can affect everyone, even people in the more advantaged group. In a primarily black class on African-American political science, Ted McDougal constantly worried about proving himself as a nonracist white person. He was hesitant to voice his thoughts, ask questions about what he didn’t understand, felt the other students weren’t including him, etc.</p>
<p>Would stereotype threat affect people who hadn’t been “hammered” with it?</p>
<ul>
<li>When (strong) white students were given a math test and told that that Asian students performed better on, they did worse.</li>
<li>Female Asian students who were reminded of gender identity/not told anything/reminded of Asian identity got 43%, 49%, and 54% of questions correct on a test from the Canadian Math Competition.</li>
</ul>
<p>To remedy stereotype threat effects, remind test takers of identities that counter the stereotype. Reminding women math students that they were “Stanford students” also helped.</p>
<h3 id="section-19">2</h3>
<p>Lower-class French students performed worse when told a test was diagnostic of language ability.</p>
<p>Questions to address: how does stereotype threat cause its effects, and what can be done to reduce its effect?</p>
<p>In particular, many people give the advice of “using the stereotype to motivate you to prove it wrong.” Is this good advice?</p>
<h2 id="identity-threat-and-the-efforting-life">6 Identity threat and the efforting life</h2>
<p>Philip Uri Treisman conducted innovative workshops teaching college math to students from groups whose math abilities are negatively stereotyped. He conducted an extensive anthropological study of his students’ work habits.</p>
<ul>
<li>Asian students studied in groups, which brought many heads together and allowed them to focus more on the concepts rather than the arithmetic. Studying together counted as social life.</li>
<li>White students studied more independently, but readily sought help outside of class and asked other students.</li>
<li>Black students were independent and private about their work; they studied for long hours alone in their room, checking answers against the back of the book. Despite the fact that they spent more time, they often did worse, creating a vicious cycle.</li>
</ul>
<p>One student, Jeff, saw that two white students reading Playboy and drinking beer in class got a A while he got a C-. The TA suggested to Jeff that he was not adequately prepared and should transfer to a community college. This was only the first blow—he hadn’t correctly predicted which courses he would fail, and felt betrayed.</p>
<h3 id="section-20">2</h3>
<p>Because organic chemistry is so important to getting into medical school, advises tell poorly performing students to drop the course and take it another semester. White and Asian students heed the advice, but black students reject it and persist.</p>
<p>To test “over-efforting”, Steele gave difficult anagram problems to black and white students, then gave them a choice of how many anagram/analogy problems they wanted to do in the next iteration. (Analogy problems are easier.) When told that anagrams were a measure of cognitive ability, blacks chose to do an average of 4 more anagram problems.</p>
<h3 id="section-21">3</h3>
<p>Stereotype threat hurts performance at the frontier of one’s skills, but boosts performance on easier tasks. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Women under stereotype threat did worse on a difficult math test but better on arithmetic.</li>
<li>Women in workplaces where they were underrepresented worked longer hours—they felt they needed to prove themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>In these situations, people are not just learning or performing, but refuting a stereotype—which can hurt their learning and performance.</p>
<p>Treisman started a program to get black students to study in groups like Asian students, and found large improvements.</p>
<h2 id="the-mind-on-stereotype-threat-racing-and-overloaded">7 The mind on stereotype threat: racing and overloaded</h2>
<h3 id="section-22">1</h3>
<p>In an experiment, men mistook the lingering anxiety they had after crossing a wobby bridge over a gorge (as opposted to crossing a less-dangerous bridge) for attraction towards the woman interviewer on the other side (as measured by how many times they called her “for more information”).</p>
<h3 id="section-23">2</h3>
<p>Groups under stereotype threat didn’t report being more anxious. People can’t judge their own anxiety levels.</p>
<h3 id="section-24">3</h3>
<ul>
<li>The blood pressure of blacks dropped during the test if they were told it was race-fair, and increased if they were told it was an intelligence test.</li>
<li>Women who were waiting to do a difficult math test were asked to write their name backwards. The women who were under stereotype threat did worse.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section-25">4</h3>
<p>Worrying about confirming a stereotype and the consequences takes up attention and distracts us from the task at hand. Researchers measured this by heartbeats (stable heartbeats indicate cognitive load). <!-- (ex. makes us vigilant to everything relevant to the threat, raises doubt, leads to constant monitoring, etc.)--></p>
<ul>
<li>In the group under stereotype threat, there is positive correlation between stability of heartbeat and performance on a difficult test. (Stability of heartbeat is a proxy for how much they are thinking about stereotypes.)</li>
<li>Women under stereotype threat remembered fewer words between sentences when asked to count vowels in sentences.</li>
<li>Researchers did fMRI scans of women students doing math problems. Women under stereotype threat did not activate regions of the brain associated with mathematical learning, but activated a region associated with social and emotional processing.</li>
</ul>
<p>What does long-term exposure to identity threats do to people? People may be paying a constant tax without realizing it.</p>
<h3 id="section-26">5</h3>
<p>Black Americans have higher rates of hypertension than white Americans. Sherman James developed a test to measure “John Henryism”—tendency to work harder when faced with problems (“persist with effortful active coping under difficult conditions”)—and found that it correlated with hypertension.</p>
<h2 id="the-strength-of-stereotype-threat-the-role-of-cues">8 The strength of stereotype threat: the role of cues</h2>
<h3 id="section-27">1</h3>
<p>Women in the Supreme Court:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sandra Day O’Connor’s early experiences on the Supreme Court were “asphyxiating” because as she was the only woman, her decisions were heavily scrutinized on all sides.</li>
<li>When Ruth Bader Ginsberg was appointed, the pressure was off. The media sought fewer interviews, and didn’t ask her as if she reprsented the “woman’s perspective”.</li>
<li>When O’Connor left, Ginsberg’s contingencies resembled the earlier contingencies of O’Connor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pressure decreased when there were two women on the Supreme Court because they had a <strong>critical mass</strong>. Critical mass is when there are enough minorities in a setting that individuals no longer feel uncomfortable because they are minorities, and thus no longer feel an interfering level of identity threat. Critical mass is different in different settings; for example, empirically speaking, conditions for women improve significantly in an orchestra with 20%/40% women.</p>
<h3 id="section-28">2</h3>
<p>How much identity threat a person feels in a setting is determined by <strong>cues</strong>. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Critical mass cue: are there enough people like you? Having enough people suggests you won’t be marginalized based on the identity.</li>
<li>When visiting a Silicon Valley startup, Steele found age cues everywhere (bicycles, unfamiliar music, etc.), and imagined that he’d be seen stereotypically (as an older person) if he worked there.</li>
<li>Is the setting organized/segregated by identity?</li>
<li>Does the setting value group diversity?</li>
<li>Do powerful people in the setting have your identity?</li>
<li>Do people express prejudice?</li>
</ul>
<p>Note identity threat is not the threat of prejudice alone; it is the threat of contingencies.</p>
<h3 id="section-29">3</h3>
<ul>
<li>Women were either given gender-stereotypical or gender-neutral commercials to watch. Those who watched stereotypical ads chose fewer math problems to work on, performed worse, and reported less interest in math-related majors.</li>
<li>Experimenters made up newsletters advertising Silicon Valley companies, varying the proportion of minorities shown and the diversity statement.
<ul>
<li>White respondents trusted the company no matter the cues.</li>
<li>When there were enough blacks, black participants trusted the company.</li>
<li>When there weren’t enough blacks, their sense of trust and belonging was conditional on the diversity policy.
<ul>
<li>A color-blind policy didn’t work.</li>
<li>A valuing-diversity policy did work.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>One cue can shape the interpretation of another. If enough cues can lead members to feel “identity safe”, then it can neutralize the impact of other cues. Changing a few critical cues may be enogh.</p>
<ul>
<li>Researchers had participants watch a video advertising a math, science and engineering leadership conference, varying the gender ratio.
<ul>
<li>Women who watched the unbalanced video had dramatically elevated heart rates, blood pressure, and sweating, and remembered more incidental features of both the video and experimental room.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reducing-identity-and-stereotype-threat-a-new-hope">9 Reducing identity and stereotype threat: A new hope</h2>
<h3 id="section-30">1</h3>
<p>When Steele started grad school, he was the only black student in the psychology program. Many incidental features of being white academics were implicitly associated with excellence; assimilation was difficult. He lacked a narrative of the situation that could inspire trust.</p>
<h3 id="section-31">2</h3>
<p>Bill Bowen was a president of Princeton who strongly believed that major policy issues in higher education should be based on empirical research. He and Bok reported in <em>The Shape of the River</em> that students admitted to several schools under affirmative action made stronger-than-average contributions downriver (later in their lives).</p>
<p>Douglas Massey found that early differences in grades between minorities and other groups is explained by different susceptibilities to stereotype threat and different levels of college preparation. There are many factors (“a thousand bites”) like family instability, segregated backgrounds, low income, networks less based on academics, etc.</p>
<p>Black professors virtually eliminated stereotype threats in their classroom.</p>
<h3 id="section-32">3</h3>
<p>Steele’s relationship with his advisor Thomas Ostrom helped nullify the negative cues not because Ostrom discussed these things with him. Rather, Tom didn’t focus on Steele at all, but on research, sending him the signal that he was a worthy research partner. A work-focused relationship acted as a positive cue comparable to the critical mass cue.</p>
<h3 id="section-33">4</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>How does a white teacher give cricial feedback to a black student so that the feedback is trusted and motivating?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The researchers assigned essays to students, gave them certain types of feedback, and measured how much they trusted their feedback and were motivated to improve the essay.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trying to be neutral or consistently prefacing feedback with a positive statement didn’t help. Black students didn’t trust this kind of feedback.</li>
<li>Explaining that they “use high standards” in evaluating the essays, that they believe the student can meet the high standards, and that the criticism was meant to help meet those standards, made them trust the feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>A possible objection:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is it a good idea to talk someone out of worrying about something that could be a real threat to her or him?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Response: It’s better to err more in the direction of greater trust than greater vigilence, because it is hard to learn without trust, and reactions to threat are costly.</p>
<h3 id="section-34">5</h3>
<p>Being shown a narrative of upperclassmen experiences (saying that when they were freshmen, they felt deep alienation, but they gradually gained a sense of belonging) increased grades of black students by <span class="math inline">\(\rc3\)</span> of a letter grade. Similarly, a late-night bull session program where groups of <span class="math inline">\(&lt;15\)</span> students talked about personally relevant topics increased grades of black students by <span class="math inline">\(\rc3\)</span> of a letter grade. The talks revealed that many stresses of college life were universally shared regardless of race.</p>
<p>Students who believed in <strong>incremental theory</strong> (i.e., having a growth mindset)—the idea that abilities are leranable and incrementally expandable—improved more than those who believed in <strong>fixed theory</strong>—ability is a fixed capacity. Black students who were given information on the expandability of human intelligence (including scientific evidence and explanations) and asked to write a letter about it improved grades by <span class="math inline">\(\rc3\)</span> of a letter grade. The task had no effect on white students.</p>
<h3 id="section-35">6</h3>
<p>Stereotype threats affect children. 5-7 year old Asian girls did worse on a math test after they colored a picture of a girl holding a doll, vs. a gender-neutral picture. Stereotype threats may be deflecting girls from an interest in math before they’ve even had a chance to engage it.</p>
<p>Note: stereotype threat may actually be weaker in identity-segregated schools. (See p. 171 for discussion.)</p>
<h3 id="section-36">7</h3>
<p><strong>Self-affirmation theory</strong> posits a basic human motive to perceive oneself as morally and adaptively adequate. For example, after a self-image threat (ex. someone shows how you have contradicted yourself), you restore your image better if you are given a chance to step back and reaffirm yourself.</p>
<p>Students were asked to write down their values and either why the values were important to them (self-affirmation), or important to other people, in 15 minutes. Black students in the self-affirmation group (but not the other group) closed the gap between themselves and white students by 40%.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>With the self-affirmation, cues became less important.</li>
<li>Better performance interrupts a vicious cycle of worry and bad performance.</li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, psychological interventions can significantly improve minority performance.</p>
<p>In an experiment, high school students were assigned a college student mentor who either emphasized the expandability of intelligence or drug abuse prevention. Girls in the first group but not the second closed the gender gap on the state math test.</p>
<h3 id="section-37">8</h3>
<p>A constellation of teacher practices and classroom practices foster identity safety, for example, positive relationships with students, use of diversity as resource, child-centered teaching, etc.</p>
<h3 id="section-38">9</h3>
<p>Reducing identity threat is necessary but not sufficent; we also need to overcome real skill and knowledge defecits. But even though background socioeconomic factors are difficult to change, remedying immediate causes (ex. having a mentor) can have a dramatic effect.</p>
<p>Although studies claim that families and not schools are major sources of inequality in student performance, perhaps the measures for school quality are not the right ones.</p>
<h3 id="section-39">10</h3>
<p>Students who underperformed on the SAT and received intervention in college not only didn’t do worse than students at the same score level, they did better than nonstereotyped students with the same prior scores. This suggests that both SAT performance and later test performance were depressed by stereotype threat.</p>
<p>Female students taking the AP Calculus exam did better when asked their gender at the end of the exam than at the beginning.</p>
<h2 id="the-distance-between-us-the-role-of-identity-threat">10 The distance between us: The role of identity threat</h2>
<h3 id="section-40">1</h3>
<p>In <em>The Failures of Integration</em>, Sheryll Cashin found through personal experience that whites avoid sitting down to blacks on planes, even when the seats are better. (This allows her to get “Southwest Airlines First Class.”)</p>
<p>The hypothesis of identity threat explains this without ascribing prejudice. Instead, white passengers could worry about being seen as racist in interacting with the black passenger, and avoid these situations completely.</p>
<p>In <em>On Paradise Drive</em>, David Brooks says that Americans are becoming more segregated into “cultural zones”. Segregation actually increased between 1986 and 2000. (The average white lives in a neighborhood 80% white; the average black lives in a neighborhood 51% black.)</p>
<p>60-90% of people got their job using some form of social capital; however most people claim that they earned the job on their own. Thus a social capital network is important. Glenn Loury (in <em>The Anatomy of Racial Inequality</em>) makes the point that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the everyday associational preferences that contribute to racially organized networks and locations in American life… may now be more important causes of racial inequality than direct discrimination against blacks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isolation is so great that black speech converges over great geographic distances and becomes more dissimilar from white speech a few miles away.</p>
<h3 id="section-41">2</h3>
<p>In a study, white students were told they would have a conversation with two black students on either “love and relationships” or “racial profiling” and asked to arrange the chairs. Students whose topic was “racial profiling” placed their seats further away. When the conversation partners were white, there was no difference.</p>
<p>The more sentence fragments the participants completed with stereotype words, the farther they sat from their partners.</p>
<p>Moreover, this was due to fear of prejudice rather than prejudice, as the distance was not correlated with scores on the Modern Racism Questionnaire and the Implicit Attitude Test.</p>
<p>In conclusion, having an interracial conversation on a racially sensitive topic made whites more mindful of the whites-as-racists stereotype, and the more mindful they were, the farther they sat.</p>
<h3 id="section-42">3</h3>
<p>Having a growth mindset nudges people away from avoidance: when the experimenter told the participant that tension was natural in discussion of racial profiling and that they should treat it as a learning experience, participants sat closer and no longer worried about being seen as racist.</p>
<p>Assuring participants that they wouldn’t be judged, or that differences in perspectives were valued, didn’t work. In fact, the more the researchers assured participants they wouldn’t judge their words, the more afraid they became!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When interactions between people from different backgrounds have learning from each other as a goal, it eases the potential tension between them, giving missteps less significance.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="conclusion-identity-as-a-bridge-between-us">11 Conclusion: Identity as a bridge between us</h2>
<p>Eliminating prejudice is not enough in building a fair society. Social and psychological contingencies have diminished but are still very powerful, and we can’t deny past history.</p>
<p>The protective side of human character can strongly affect our entire brain functioning without our conscious knowledge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unless you make people feel safe from the risk of these identity predicaments in identity-integrated settings, you won’t succeed in reducing group achievement gaps or in enabling people from different backgrounds to work comfortably and well together.</p>

<p>Actions we can take include</p>
<ul>
<li>changing the way we give feedback</li>
<li>increasing a group’s size beyond critical mass</li>
<li>fostering intergroup conversations</li>
<li>allow students to affirm their most valued sense of self and develop a narrative about their setting</li>
</ul>

<p>For this monthly summary I’ll instead write about a few highlights/threads that stood out to me, and draw connections between some of the different items.</p>
<ul>
<li>Modeling one’s society of mind: I just finished reading <a href="http://crystal.raelifin.com/">Crystal Society</a> (which I greatly enjoyed), a story from an AI point of view. In the story, the AI has several different “goal threads” which operate as distinct characters—<strong>Face, Growth, Wiki, Safety, Dream, Heart</strong>. It led me to think about modeling myself in terms of multiple goal threads/personalities, and casting internal dialogues using this kind of fiction. In other words, I’m attributing different goals to different, named parts of myself. (See also my post on <a href="https://holdenlee.wordpress.com/2015/07/18/inside-out/">Inside Out</a>.)
<ul>
<li>There was a discussion on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!topic/cfar-alumni/lzWtpmMFPn8">CFAR alumni thread</a> (private link) on this.</li>
<li>In his blog, <a href="http://mory.buxner.com/#a2203110">Mory Buxner</a> documents his adventures in modeling his own society of mind: he creates a “game” (with scoring) where he switches between these different characters, and has dialogues between them (<strong>Explorer, worker, gamer, musician, programmer, thinker, addict, person</strong>).</li>
<li><a href="http://agentyduck.blogspot.com/2016/04/the-people-in-my-head-who-make-me-do.html">The People In My Head Who Make Me Do Things</a>: Brienne Yudkowsky comes up with <strong>Obsession, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodama_(spirit)">Kodama</a>, Progress, Avlokiteśvara</strong> (Bodhisattva), <strong>Sovereign, Dream</strong>.</li>
<li><a href="http://malcolmocean.com/2016/04/introducing-the-cast/">Introducing the cast (of Malcolm Ocean)</a>: The characters are <strong>Mastermind, Dream, Crave, Taste, Clarity, Interface, Harmony</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/scott-aaronson-answers-every-ridiculously-big-question-i-throw-at-him/?wt.mc=SA_Twitter-Share">Interview with Scott Aaronson</a> <a href="http://scrible.com/s/2LMmk">h</a> His quote is on point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I love when the human race gains new knowledge, in math or history or anything else. I love when important decisions fall into the hands of people who constantly second-guess themselves and worry that their own ‘tribe’ might be mistaken, who are curious about science and have a sense of the ironic and absurd. I love when society’s outcasts, like Alan Turing or Michael Burry (who predicted the subprime mortgage crisis), force everyone else to pay attention to them by being inconveniently right. And whenever I read yet another thinkpiece about the problems with ‘narrow-minded STEM nerds’—how we’re basically narcissistic children, lacking empathy and social skills, etc. etc.—I think to myself, ‘then let everyone else be as narrow and narcissistic as most of the STEM nerds I know; I have no further wish for the human race.’</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">Meditations on Moloch</a> <a href="http://scrible.com/s/mDwik">h</a> When individual agents are grouped together in larger systems, the system has an emergent character and can do things that none of the individuals wants (ex. different nations engage in arms races—these situations often have a “Prisoner’s Dilemma” nature); in order to survive in such a world, individuals may have to give up their values and optimize for something that they don’t want to optimize. Systems that manipulate people in this way can destroy the world, and in fact, already exert a strong influence.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Giving this kind of force a name, Moloch, helps us recognize this influence.</p>
Moreover, as technology becomes more powerful, Moloch only becomes more powerful. Scott further argues that we are in a rare period of relative peace. He argues that the best way to destroy Moloch is to install another god (i.e., superintelligent AI) in its place.
<ul>
<li><p>I’m unsure what to make of the conclusion of the argument, but I think the question of how to defend against Moloch is a very pressing one. You don’t have to look towards armaggeddon examples—it rears its head any time society exerts pressure on the individual. A down-to-earth example is a workaholic culture (it’s hard to go against the grain, both socially and economically). Why hasn’t the dream of machines decreasing work for humans been realized?</p>
<p>And here is a proposed solution: <a href="http://freakonomics.com/podcast/mincome/">Is the world ready for a guaranteed basic income?</a> The podcast makes the very good point that “If you look at the 18th and at the 19th century, some of the great scientific breakthroughs and some of the great cultural breakthroughs were made by people who did not work,”<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and it does a good job of exploring the research and pros/cons of a guaranteed income.</p>
One continual source of conflict between people who want technological progress and people who are skeptical is that “it takes away jobs!” A guaranteed basic income certainly seems like a tempting solution—but even some kind of a safety net that is more narrowly targeted could resolve this conflict.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Society pressures men to conform to some stereotype of masculinity, for example, display of emotions is often stigmatized. The first step is to acknowledge that there <em>is</em> a systemic gender problem that is plaguing men. Here are two articles on this topic:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://norasamaran.com/2016/02/11/the-opposite-of-rape-culture-is-nurturance-culture-2/">The opposite of rape culture is nurturance culture</a> <a href="http://scrible.com/s/6dwi4">h</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/education/edlife/teaching-men-to-be-emotionally-honest.html">Teaching men to be emotionally honest</a> <a href="http://scrible.com/s/m5MO4">h</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>I watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0787524/">The man who knew infinity</a>, which is a beautifully sad film about Ramanujan that is faithful to the subject of mathematics<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, of the same caliber as A Beautiful Mind. The film focuses on the relationship between Ramanujan and Hardy, who had to overcome large cultural and personal differences in order to collaborate. For me, it really drives home how sad it is that these kinds of differences <em>do</em> keep people from connecting.</li>
<li>This post on <a href="https://usamo.wordpress.com/2015/03/14/writing/">writing</a> (<a href="http://www.scrible.com/contentview/page/I4GO0414201092M820S1033K0K40MK2M:218133790/index.html?utm_source=tb_permalink&amp;utm_medium=permalink&amp;utm_campaign=tb_buttons&amp;_sti=2865473">h</a> ) captures the essence of why writing is useful: writing serves as external memory, forces you to think about the ideas, and is a way to move closer to the truth.</li>

    <p>Here’s a list of what I’ve read/listened to/watched the past month.</p>
<p>(*) means particularly interesting, and (h) are links to personal highlights.</p>
<p>Check out my new blog <a href="http://holdenlee.github.io/philosophocle">Philosophocle</a>, which I’m updating it twice per week. We’re currently in the middle of a Creativist vs. Uniformist debate…</p>
<ul>
<li>Rationality
<ul>
<li><a href="http://agentyduck.blogspot.com/">Agenty Duck</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://agentyduck.blogspot.com/2016/02/favorite-emotions.html">Favorite emotions</a>. Answers to “What is your favorite emotion, and what’s an example of something that has made you feel that way?” The emotions that people want are a lot more variegated than just happiness.</li>
<li>(*) <a href="http://agentyduck.blogspot.com/2016/01/when-your-left-arm-becomes-chicken-dont.html">When your left arm becomes chicken</a>: “Imagine three peasant men who are hopelessly in love with a princess who will never return their affections, and each of them is fully aware that she’s unattainable.”
<ul>
<li>The first, an “aesthete”, changes what he loves (his values) from the princess to someone who is attainable.</li>
<li>The second, the “Knight of Faith”, keeps believing that he can win the love of the princess, despite its high unlikelihood.</li>
<li>The third, the “Knight of Infinite Resignation”, realizes that his love (value) cannot be satisfied, but keeps on loving the princess anyway. Allegorically, the rationalist is the “Knight of Infinite Resignation”.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="http://agentyduck.blogspot.com/2016/01/on-finishing-projects.html">On finishing projects</a>, see also Malcolm’s post on starting books. To build habits, focus first on the “minimal effective action” (MEA).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Malcolm Ocean
<ul>
<li><a href="http://malcolmocean.com/2014/07/focus-on-starting-books/">Focus on starting books</a>: Many people make a goal to read <em>n</em> books in a year. But “finishing books” may just be a proxy for what you actually want, e.g., reading books, so may not be the best thing to measure. Ex. for me personally it makes me want to get stuck trudging through books I started but didn’t like, and disincentivizes starting new books—the opposite of what I want.</li>
<li><a href="http://malcolmocean.com/2016/02/phone-while-driving-metaphor/">Don’t get distracted and crash</a>: The key difference between talking on the phone and talking to a passenger while driving is not how distracting it is, but that the passenger has <strong>situational awareness</strong> and <strong>shared intent/aligned interests</strong>. This applies not just to driving—when you’re working, are the people around you hurting you (e.g. being a voice on the phone) or helping you (e.g. having your interests in mind)?</li>

<li><a href="http://mindingourway.com/defiance/">Defiance</a> See also the <a href="http://mindingourway.com/guilt/">Replacing Guilt series</a> People often make fun of “desperation” in the sense of caring very much about something. Nate Soares argues that it’s good to “get desperate” about something. A good litmus test is, “is there something you would go all out for?”</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Our culture has strong social stigmas against people who really unabashedly care about something…</p>
<p>The stereotypical stigma against “nerds” seems rooted at least partially in a stigma against caring too much…</p>
<p>Caring hard is vulnerable. If you care hard about something, then it becomes possible to lose something very important to you. Worse, everyone around you might think that you’re putting your caring into thewrong thing, and see you as one of the naive blind idealist sheeple, and curl their lips at you.</p>

    <p>I’m excited to start my (unpaid) job as webmaster of the Philosophocle blog <a href="http://holdenlee.github.io/philosophocle">philosophocle.tk</a>. Philosophocle is an institution of higher learning in a historically inwardly turned country that has sadly been neglected in current affairs. We hope that this blog will facilitate cultural exchange between Philosophocle and the wider world. Please read, subscribe, and share!</p>
<p>Here is an excerpt of the first post, <a href="http://holdenlee.github.io/philosophocle/posts/the-street.html">The Street</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Philosophocle, the street is lined with cafes and snackeries. Each advertises a different atmosphere. The high-class Starset has individual tables, uniformed waiters with silver-star badges, mochas drawn in the shape of maidens, and hot chocolate in tall glasses with swirly chocolate straws. The crowd-pleasing Delites offers bubble tea, self-serve yogurt machines with toppings, and mochis in tantalizing rows beneath cartoon pictures of themselves, the color of their filling leaking through their faces like a soft blush. <!--more--> Simplitea provides a tea bag, hot water, and a place to sit for 50 cents. At Delites you go with a group of friends - no one will pay attention to you if you go alone - but at Serendipiteas, you are ushered in to a random seat, facing someone you do not know. In Melli’s Flows the conversations never stop, hurried on by the always-present bubbling fountain (careful: the fish bite), and guests are encouraged to journey from table to table, with different h’ors d’oveures at each table to tempt (free with entrance ticket). <a href="http://holdenlee.github.io/philosophocle/posts/the-street.html">Read more.</a></p>
